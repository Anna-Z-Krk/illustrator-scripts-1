======================
JavaScript scripts for Adobe Illustrator CSx.

ovalize.jsx
======================
This script turns every selected path into an oval which fits the width and the height of the path.  
If the width and the height are equal, it turns into a circle.

You can specify the number of the anchor points before the script modifies the paths.

You can use this script in the case if you want to draw a circle or an oval which has the number of the anchor points other than four.  
Draw a circle with the ellipse tool, select it, run this script, input the number and you are done.

Please notice the case 3 of the above image. This is a feature for now.
